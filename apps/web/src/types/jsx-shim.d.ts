/**
 * JSX Type Shim for React 19 Compatibility
 *
 * React 19 changed the JSX runtime types, causing compatibility issues with
 * third-party libraries like @heroicons/react, qrcode.react, and react-router-dom
 * that haven't yet updated their type definitions.
 *
 * The issue is that React 19's stricter types require ReactElement to have
 * a `children` property to be assignable to ReactNode, but many libraries
 * return ReactElement without this constraint.
 *
 * This workaround makes the JSX.Element type compatible with these libraries.
 * @see https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/discussions/69006
